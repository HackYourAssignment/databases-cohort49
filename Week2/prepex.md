Adding Primary Keys

    Ensure each table has a unique identifier:
        Recipes Table: recipe_id (Primary Key)
        Ingredients Table: ingredient_id (Primary Key)
        Categories Table: category_id (Primary Key)

- Linking Tables with Foreign Keys

    Foreign Key Relationships:
        Recipes Table: Add a category_id foreign key referencing the Categories table.
        Ingredients Table: Add a recipe_id foreign key referencing the Recipes table to link ingredients to specific recipes.
- Identifying Relationships Between Tables

    One-to-Many Relationships:
        One category can have multiple recipes (Category to Recipes).
        One recipe can have multiple ingredients (Recipe to Ingredients).
    Many-to-Many Relationships (if necessary):
        If you have multiple categories for a recipe or ingredients that can belong to multiple recipes, consider a join table (e.g., RecipeIngredients for linking recipes and ingredients).
