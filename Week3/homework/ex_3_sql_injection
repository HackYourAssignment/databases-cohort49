/* 

Parameterized Query: The query uses ?? and ? placeholders for Country, name, and code, respectively.

?? is used for the table name, ensuring it is safely included without risk of injection.
? is used for name and code, which protects them from injection.

Secure Parameter Passing: I passed the values [Country, name, code] as an array to the query. 
This approach ensures that these values are correctly escaped by the MySQL library, preventing SQL injection.
