Q1: what columns violate 1NF?
A1: 
- 1NF:
food_code and food_description columns contain multiple values in
a single cell.

While dinner_date only hold dates, dates seem to be in different formats
indicating using different data types(domains) to store the date. (not sure)

- even though in order to examine xNF the table needs to first satisfy (x-1)NF
we can see directly that the db will still violate other xNFs even after solving 
the above problem:
* the minimal candidate/super key is (member_id, dinner_id)

- 2NF: partial dependencies problem
  member_id => member_name, member_address
  dinner_id => dinner_date

- 3NF: transitive dependencies problem
  dinner_id => venue_code And venue_code => venue_description
  dinner_id => food_code And food_code => food_description

3.5NF: I do not see any relationship where a determinant is not a super key.
4NF: I do not see any A ->-> B where B is independent of the other attributes.

I am not sure that my understanding of 3.5 and 4 is right :)

Q2: What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
Q3:Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

A2 & A3: proposed tables/entities and fields with defining the relationships
using foreign keys: 
F:foreign P:primary K:key

- Venue (PK/venue_code, venue_description)
- Member (PK/member_id, member_name, member_address)
- Dinner (PK/dinner_id, dinner_date, FK/venue_code)
- Food (PK/food_code, food_description)

- Member_Dinner (PK/ (FK/member_id, FK/dinner_id))

- Dinner_Food (PK/ (FK/dinner_id, FK/food_code))
