# SQL Normalization Solution

## 1. Columns Violating 1NF

- `food_code` and `food_description` contain multiple values separated by commas. This violates 1NF.

## 2. Recognizable Entities

1. **Member** (attributes: `member_id`, `member_name`, `member_address`)
2. **Dinner** (attributes: `dinner_id`, `venue_code`)
3. **Venue** (attributes: `venue_code`, `venue_description`)
4. **Food** (attributes: `food_code`, `food_description`)
5. **DinnerFood** (for many-to-many relationship between Dinner and Food)
6. **MemberDinner** (for many-to-many relationship between Member and Dinner)

## 3. 3NF-Compliant Tables
